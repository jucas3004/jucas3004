### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jucas3004/jucas3004** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying geology at EAFIT University. 

So I really don't know what to put here haha...

I guess that I could say that I don't know much about programming :/

BUT... I do aknowledge the importance of having good programming skills for understanding the giant rock we call home. 

I love maths, and i love how they allow us to explain so many processes that occur in nature. 

I want to learn how to use the sofisticated tools that modernity offers, to at least grasp the complex mysteries hidden beneath our feet.
